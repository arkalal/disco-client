# Rules

- Never use typescript and Tailwind CSS.
- if require to install an NPM package, always analyse the package.json file and find out which package needs to be installed as per requirement and install it.
- ALwasy use "use client" at the top of functional components which is using client side code like react hooks but not for all components.
- Never write refresh setInterval logics meaninglessly unless instructed.
- ALways use this method - "../../../" for importing in the components.
- We use NPM so always use that. No Yarn.
- Under the src folder, only the app folder will be there under which we will have the api folder which is the normal NextJS app router concept, but apart from them all the other folders like utils etc, will be under the root project.
- All the components will be under the components folder under the root project.
- There must be no duplication of same files or having any empty folders in the project. Always check that. If you find it, then remove it after checking which is important to keep.
- Never break or disturb any other existing code while coding something or implementing some changes.
- Never change or update any code if not instructed. Only Stick to the specific task that has been instructed to you to do.
- If we are using mongoose schema then always create a models folder in the root of the project where you will create the schema JS files.
- Do not miss any points that I have explained to you. Make sure you follow and implement each and everything that I have told you in the composer.
